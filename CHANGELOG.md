## [3.0.2]

- Fix a few issues in the README documentation ([#73](https://github.com/customerio/customerio-node/pull/73))
- Allow `subject` and `body` to be overridden independent of `from` for transactional messages ([#75](https://github.com/customerio/customerio-node/pull/75))

## [3.0.1]

- Fix an issue calculating the content length of multi-byte utf-8 string characters ([#69](https://github.com/customerio/customerio-node/pull/69))

## [3.0.0]

- (**BREAKING**) Remove the dependency on `request` ([#62](https://github.com/customerio/customerio-node/pull/62))

  - We don't expect this to break many consumers of `customerio-node`. Unless you were using [`request`](https://github.com/request/request#requestoptions-callback) specific options, you don't need to make any changes.

- (**BREAKING**) Return an `Error` instance for non-`2XX` status codes ([#62](https://github.com/customerio/customerio-node/pull/62))

  - We don't expect this to break many consumers of `customerio-node`. Unless you were using `instanceof` to check the type of error returned from track or api methods, you don't need to make any changed. `message`, `statusCode`, `response`, and `body` are still accessible as properties on the error.

- (**BREAKING**) `trackAnonymous` now requires an `anonymous_id` and cannot trigger campaigns. If you previously used anonymous events to trigger campaigns, you can still do so [directly through the API](https://customer.io/docs/api/#operation/trackAnonymous). We now refer to anonymous events that trigger campaigns as "invite events".

- (**BREAKING**) Restructure the package to have a single entry point, rather than three. This is more of a standard package structure, and is more future-proof. ([#63](https://github.com/customerio/customerio-node/pull/63))

- Return a readable message when the server returns an array of errors instead of `Unknown error` ([#62](https://github.com/customerio/customerio-node/pull/62))
